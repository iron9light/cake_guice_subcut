 * A mutable binding module. This module is used during construction of bindings configuration
 * with the DSL, but may also be used as a mutable binding module in its own right. Anyone wishing
 * to use the mutable binding module to inject a real system should be aware that they take on all
 * responsibility for threading issues with such usage. For example, tests running in parallel could
 * reconfigure the same binding and cause a race condition which will cause the tests to fail.
 * As such, direct usage of the mutable binding module, particularly in a production environment, is
 * strongly discouraged. Use NewBindingModule instead to ensure immutability and thread safety.
 * <p/>
 * The MutableBindingModule is also provided on a per-function usage by the modifyBindings method on
 * BindingModule. This is the recommended way to have rebindings on a test-by-test basis and is
 * thread safe, as each test gets a new copy of the binding module and will not interfere with others.
 * <p/>
 * An example usage will look like this:
 * <pre>
 * class SomeBindings extends NewBindingModule ({ implicit module =>
 *   module.bind[Trait1] toSingleInstance new Class1Impl
 * })
 *
 * // in a test...
 * SomeBindings.modifyBindings { testBindings =>  // holds mutable copy of SomeBindings
 *   module.bind[Trait1] toSingleInstance mockClass1Impl  // where the mock has been set up already
 *   // run tests using the mockClass1Impl
 * }  // coming out of scope destroys the temporary mutable binding module
